This project is being undertaken to explore the use of Python to directly control GPIO attached hardware on a Rapsberry Pi.

Todo:

  * ~~make stepper motor class~~

  * ~~make nunchuck class~~

  * Home finding on the rotation:i.e. exposing a setHome method to rotate back to the original point of zero when the  motor was initialized.

  * Allow input from the nunchuck to directly control the stepper

  * get input from kinect

  * allow kinect motion to directly control the stepper, via some tracking suite

  * build out the physical hardware to house the separate components
